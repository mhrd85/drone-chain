Drone-Chain’s core functional objective is to bridge two environments:  on-chain and off-chain

The Drone_Chain provides a reliable tamper-proof network for complex smart contracts on any blockchain. Building a precious smart contract requires the use of multiple inputs to verify contractual performance and various outputs to affect external systems and/or send payment to execute the smart contract. Smart contracts require secure middleware to connect them to off-chain data which exists in the real world. This off-chain data will act as the inputs for the contracts. Drone-Chain’s decentralized oracle network provides the same security guarantees using smart contracts. By allowing multiple nodes to evaluate the same data before it becomes a trigger.
